# Tsunami
An superior alternative to LOIC

Tsunami is a more professional and efficient version of the network stress
tester / denial of service tool known as LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon). Its
simple GUI makes it easy to use the program, whilst compact and efficient
code means that the program doesn't hog system resources (Aside from network
resources of course ;) ) and runs quickly and smoothly.

Version 2:

+ Added ability to use Layer 7 attack methods
+ Layer 7 attacks can be done using "Slow headers" or "Slow posts"
+ Two tabs - one for Layer 4 and the other for Layer 7 attacks

* Bug fixed
* Improved status indicator
* Improved stability
