# Tsunami
A superior alternative to LOIC and Switchblade

Tsunami is a more professional and efficient version of the network stress
tester / denial of service tools known as LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) and
Switchblade (Used for Layer 7 attacks). Its simple GUI makes it easy to use
the program, whilst compact and efficient code means that the program doesn't
hog system resources and runs quickly and smoothly. It also combines two
DoS (Denial of Service) attack methods (Layer 4 and Layer 7) into one, where
switching between them takes only one click! As a result, there are no bulky
files or entire folders of required librarys so transporting Tsunami is a
walk in the park.

Version 2:

+ Added ability to use Layer 7 attack methods
+ Layer 7 attacks can be done using "Slow headers" or "Slow posts"
+ Two tabs - one for Layer 4 and the other for Layer 7 attacks

* Bug fixes
* Improved status indicator
* Improved stability
